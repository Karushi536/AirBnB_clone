Welcome to the AirBNB clone project done BY Mwangangi and Karushi.

For the first step we were to write a comand line interpreter to manage the airbnb objects.
Thisstep isimportant because it will be used to build the following projects: HTML/CSS templating, database storage, API, front-end integration…
Each task is linked and will help you to:

    put in place a parent class (called BaseModel) to take care of the initialization, serialization and deserialization of your future instances
    create a simple flow of serialization/deserialization: Instance <-> Dictionary <-> JSON string <-> file
    create all classes used for AirBnB (User, State, City, Place…) that inherit from BaseModel
    create the first abstracted storage engine of the project: File storage.
    create all unittests to validate all our classes and storage engine

Execution:
Interactive mode:
$ ./console.py
(hbnb) help

Documented commands (type help <topic>):
========================================
EOF  help  quit

(hbnb) 
(hbnb) 
(hbnb) quit
$

Non-interactive mode:
$ echo "help" | ./console.py
(hbnb)

Documented commands (type help <topic>):
========================================
EOF  help  quit
(hbnb) 
$
$ cat test_help
help
$
$ cat test_help | ./console.py
(hbnb)

Documented commands (type help <topic>):
========================================
EOF  help  quit
(hbnb) 
$

All tests should also pass in non-interactive mode: $ echo "python3 -m unittest discover tests" | bash
